This project transforms complex inventory and logistics data into a visually intuitive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor stock health, optimize replenishment, and improve operational efficiency.

* Data Transformation: Applied Power Query for end-to-end ETL, including data cleansing, standardization, and integration of inventory, product, supplier, location, and delivery datasets.

* Data Modeling: Built a structured Star Schema with fact tables for stock movement and orders, and dimension tables for products, categories, dates, locations, suppliers, and delivery modes—ensuring scalable and high-performance reporting.

* Advanced Calculations: Created DAX measures to track key inventory KPIs such as stock quantity, stock value, order quantity, stock-out rate, average lead time, re-order levels, and product turnover, including YoY and rolling period analysis.

* Visualization: Designed a professional and interactive dashboard with drill-down capabilities across time, category, product, geography, and delivery mode. This allows users to easily move from high-level insights to detailed product-level analysis.

**# Key Deliverables**

* Actionable Insights: Clear visibility into stock levels, valuation, turnover speed, stock-out risks, and lead-time performance to support informed inventory and procurement decisions.

* Interactive Reporting: Dynamic filters and drill-through pages allowing users to analyze inventory performance by category, product, region, warehouse, and supplier.

* Scalable Architecture: A robust and extensible BI solution built to support future enhancements such as demand forecasting, automated alerts, and advanced supply-chain analytics.
